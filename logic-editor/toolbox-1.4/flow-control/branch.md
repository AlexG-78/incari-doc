# Overview

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/branch-node.png)

Like a branch on a tree, the **Branch Node** splits a single path into two diverging paths. Which branch of logic is executed depends on a single condition, which can itself be composed of multiple conditions. At a high level it basically means "_If this is true, do this; if not, do this._" which sounds relatively simplistic, however, branching is a foundational concept of creating interactive logic, similar to using _if statements_ in programming, and when combined with **Relational Expression**, **Pulse Flow** and **Logical Operator** **Nodes**, we can build incredibly complex systems.

# Uses

There are infinite uses for the **Branch Node**, however a very basic example would be a single input condition, which triggers one of two functions. In the example below we use a **Variable** to represent whether the unit of measurement for distance is set to _km/h_ or _mph_, and trigger functions to display data in the corresponding format.

By utilising various other nodes, we can define logical outcomes based on multiple conditions. In the example below we have four **Variables**, representing whether or not each of four car doors are open. By using the **Logical Operator Node**, **OR**, and triggering them all using a **Sequential Node**, we can trigger an alarm if any of the doors are open.

# Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|*Pulse Input* (â–º)|**Pulse**|A standard **Input Pulse**, to trigger the execution of the **Node**.|

# Outputs

|Output|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|OnTrue|**Pulse**|Triggers the execution of subsequent logic if **Input** condition is _True_.|
|OnFalse|**Pulse**|Triggers the execution of subsequent logic if **Input** condition is _False_.|
